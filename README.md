# ImageViewer
Comprehensive Experiments for Digital Media Processing, School of Digital Media and Design Arts, BUPT

A digital image processing(DIP) software based on Qt Creater platform and C++. All operations and functions in this project are based on my own implementation of a [tempelate matrix class](https://github.com/HelloSangShen/Matrix), which is in my GitHub as well . All image processing functions are stated as follows. 

1. Image spatial transform
   - RGB to gray
   - Color reversal
   - Log transform
   - Histogram equalization in RGB, gray, HSI
2. Image spatial filter
   - Linear filter
   - Gaussian filter
   - Bilateral filter
   - Median filtering
3. Morphological filtering
   - Dilation and erosion
   - Opening & closing
4. Frequency domain filtering
   - Two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform(2D-FFT)
   - Gaussian filter in frequency domain

etc.
